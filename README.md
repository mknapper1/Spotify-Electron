Spotify Electron
===================

With the recent news that the native Spotify app is killing hard drives and SSDs with excessive read and writes [according to this source](https://www.macintouch.com/forums/showthread.php?tid=1046) and confirmed by myself and others. I started looking for alternatives but the only option was Spotify's web app. I didn't want to keep Spotify running in a browser window so I wrapped it up in Electron. This was accomplished easily thanks to https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier. This build only works with MacOS, but if I get a request I can package it up for Windows and Linux as well.
